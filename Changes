Revision history for Perl extension Games::Multiplayer::Manager.

1.01  Thu Aug  3 13:16:00 2006
	- Fixed a few bugs with arrays being returned by the module. It used to return "0"
		when the array would've been empty, causing $array[0] = 0. This has been fixed.
		empty arrays return empty now.
	- Revised the module page. The broadcast handler receives "to" and "message" as
		the hash keys, not "msg".
	- Fixed the test script; Makefile should install more smoothly now.

1.00  Tue Jan 18 14:42:47 2005
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
		-X -n Games::Multiplayer::Manager
